				<p>Patty Kim Hamilton is a playwright and performance maker, currently completing her masters in Scenic Writing at the University of the Arts, Berlin. She received her Bachelors with Honors from Stanford University, where she was the recipient of the Sherifa Omade Edoga Prize for Work Addressing Social Issues. As Playwright-in-Residence at the Shakespeare Academy at Stratford, CT, she developed her play ‘Peeling Oranges’, (Special Mention: Deutsches Theater, Autorentheatertage 2021, excerpt published in Bella Triste Literary Magazine) . Her play ‘ICH HÄTTE GERN ZU MEINER LEBZEIT KEIN KRIEG (I don't wanna experience war)’ will premiere at Stadttheater Bremerhaven, June 2021. Her play 'when it hurts // this body is just a house' was a semi-finalist for the 2020 Eugene O'Neill Playwrights Conference and selected as part of Cimientos 2021 at IATI Theatre (NY). Her work exists at the intersection of the intimate and the political - meditating on bodies, family, language and healing. She is currently the Assistant Director of Gob Squad Collective’s work-in-development, as well as part of the Netflix writing assistant program, supporting the development of a new series in Berlin. She also has a shrine dedicated to Ana Mendienta + Snoop Dog.</p>
